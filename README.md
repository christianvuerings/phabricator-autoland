## FAQ

### My diff has a ‚ùå next to it, what is going on?

Hover over the icon to get more information. For every diff we perform these checks:
* Builds pass
* Active landing operation passes
* The `#autoland` tag is included in the summary

### How does the extension work?

1. Ping the phabricator URL on a regular basis to get all the accepted diffs
2. For each accepted diff, check whether the builds have passed
3. If they do and the `#autoland` tag is included in the summary, autoland the diff
4. To autoland the diff, we wait until the user is idle for 15 seconds.
5. If they are idle, open a tab in the background and perform the `Land Revision` action
